# Replication

## Overview:

Replication enables data to be copied from one server to the other server or servers.
It's a very powerful feature because you're creating a copy or copies of your data to different servers. The main server is called as 'Master' server while the server/servers to which data is getting copied are called 'Slaves'.

### Please refer to the files in this repository for understanding replication.
